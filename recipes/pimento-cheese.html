        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pimento cheese is a spread or dip made from shredded cheese, mayonnaise, and pimento peppers, a sweet and mild variety of red pepper. It's a popular dish in the American South, often enjoyed as a sandwich filling or with crackers and vegetables. Pimento cheese has a creamy texture, a slightly spicy flavor from the pimentos, and a tangy, cheesy taste. </p>
